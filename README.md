# django-exercise

Let's write: a service registry, in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Project requirements

Basic list of requirements can be found in "features" directory that highlights the very high overview of how it is supposed to be working. It is intentionally imperfact and the details of implementation are left upto you. Any changes and decisions you make should be reflected in feature files with corresponding step implementations for [Behave](http://pythonhosted.org/behave/) (or similar library). In short if it is not in feature files, it doesn't exist and has no right to exist in code.

## Your task

You do not have to complete all of the requirements, that would take too long for this exercise.
Instead I want you to try and write a part of it.

Which part it will be is entirely up to you. You can focus on the API part of things and write beautiful restful automation for all the services, design API for registration and then searching/retrieving, checking health etc. This would mostly demonstrate your knowledge of architecture, designing, planning and documenting.

Or you could instead write a solid backend that not only is easy to expand but also to scale, either from scratch or on top of an existing solution (Celery is a good example) in which case I would expect installation automation to go along with it. This certainly would highlight your developer aspects, knowledge of common problems that come with vertical and horizontal scaling etc.

Or anything else you could potentially imagine. I do not expect you to deliver anything that would be considered finished and I want you to spend no more than 2-4 hours on this. What I want to shine through is how do you approach this sort of a project, where do you begin and how is your work process like. For these reasons I would like you to commit as often as you can, with good, clean commit messages.

Provide a note explaining:

- What you have done
- What are your plans for the future (if you were to keep working on it)
- Possible problems that are yet to be conquered, preferably with potential solutions.

When you are done please open a pull request to this repo with your solution.
